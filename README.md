# Wheel Rides

This is a web app that allows users to search and reserve different bikes at various locations .

This web app not only allows users to reserve bikes, but it also provides a number of other important features to enhance the user experience. One key functionality is the ability for users to view and manage their existing reservations. This includes the ability to view the details of their reservation, update or cancel it if necessary, and even rate their reservation once it has been completed.

This project makes use of modern web technologies, such as React, Node.js, Redux, and TypeORM ,NestJS,Sqlite3.
